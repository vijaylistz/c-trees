So there are a ton if interesting and fancy algorithms using trees.  In order to investigate these thing I hope to accomplish the following things
	-> Produce functional implementations in C using pointers
	-> Produce thorough documentation for each data type, so A) I can remember what they do and B) So other people will be able to				use the implementation (Nicely formatted comments in code)
	-> Historical/Misc information (tex files)
	-> Test Cases or sample applications.


Here is a preliminary list of the structures I want to have done at some point all of this is ganked from Wikipedia-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures (stars indicate priority):
